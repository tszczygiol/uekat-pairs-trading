# Pitch

The project was developed as part of the **"Rynek Finansowy"** course at the University of Economics in Katowice. It presents an implementation of the **pairs trading strategy** using Python and its libraries. Calculations are performed on historical data of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW), but the final selection of stocks is left to the User.

The main purpose of this project is educational. It aims to present the key steps necessary to understand and apply this trading strategy.
